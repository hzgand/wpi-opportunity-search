The RA will work on bringing together on a WPI Linux server two pieces of software: \r\n(a) a C++ code of an existing professional/commercial simulator (designed for modeling a wide array of scenarios and applications in EE) developed by a software company in Europe and brought in WPI using container technologies; \r\n(b) a neural network optimization procedure (WPI-born, implemented in MATLAB) controlling the simulator (a) for generation of data for optimization. \r\n     In the fall 2022, after successful combination of (a) and (b) in a solver-optimizer operating at the WPI Linux machine, the same work in their coupling will be repeated at High Performance Computing facilities at the ORNL. The RA will be invited to continue their work on the project at this next stage. Later stages of the project could include various topics, including the development of novel deep learning/neural network algorithms.\r\n     Collaboration with project partners: the work in coupling (a) and (b) will be done under direct guidance by their developers (at Dartmouth College, NH and QWED, Poland) and under supervision of the ORNL. \r\n     '40 h per week' above means that compensation for a full time job (within two months) is available. The actual work supported by this compensation can, however, spread over a longer period than two summer months. ",
